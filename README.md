# FreeBSD Kernel Hacking

Exercises from Joseph Kong's [Designing BSD Rootkits](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593271428.do), updated for FreeBSD 11/12.

Even though the book is over 10 years old, it's highly recommended as it's quite a challenge to update the source code provided in the book to work on modern releases.
